 * A presentation model contains a list of Attribute objects.
 * Every Attribute object belongs to only one presentation model.
 * <p/>
 * Each Attribute is uniquely identified by a property name and a tag value (which if not specified defaults to "VALUE".)
 * <p/>
 * Each Attribute stores a value and a base (or original) value.  An Attribute also maintains a dirty flag, which is
 * true whenever the current value and the base (original) value are different.
 * <p/>
 * In addition, a qualifier string may be specified for an attribute; a qualifier has application-specific
 * semantics, but is generally used to identify all attributes (regardless of the presentation model to which
 * they belong) which refer to the same domain model object.
