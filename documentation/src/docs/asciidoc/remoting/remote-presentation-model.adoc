=== The Remote Presentation Model

Remote Presentation Model (RPM) is a software design pattern for implementing
user interfaces. Like Model View Controller (MVC) it divides a module into
three parts:

* Model
* View
* Controller

The main difference to MVC is that the Controller part of the RPM pattern
is separated from the view. In a client server architecture the controller
part is defined on the server. By doing so several benefits of server
site programming can be directly used in the controller. In addition the view
part is mostly extreme lightweight and can easily be replaced. Both controller
and view know the model and can interact with the model. Since the components
RPM pattern can be separated on client and server the model must be synchronized
between client and server.

Since view and controller can interact with the model it’s a best practice
to support the observer pattern for the model. By doing so the view can simply
bind its components to properties of the model and the server can react on
changes by simply adding a lister to an observable property.

The Rico remoting API provides an implementation of the Remote Presentation
Model pattern. This documentation provides descriptions and samples of the
public model, controller and view APIs of the Rico remoting API.
